            <h5>Description</h5>
            <p>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. In computer science, algorithms are fundamental to solving complex problems efficiently. They are used to process data, perform calculations, and automate reasoning tasks.</p>

            <h5>Types of Algorithms</h5>
            <p>There are several types of algorithms, each designed to solve specific kinds of problems. Some of the most common types include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong>: These algorithms are used to arrange data in a particular order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).</li>
              <li><strong>Searching Algorithms</strong>: These algorithms are used to find an element in a data structure (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search).</li>
              <li><strong>Graph Algorithms</strong>: Used to solve problems related to graph structures (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm).</li>
              <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>: Used for optimization problems, breaking down problems into simpler subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack Problem).</li>
              <li><strong>Divide and Conquer</strong>: A problem-solving technique that divides the problem into smaller subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          {/* Section for Algorithm Complexity */}
          <section>
            <h5>Algorithm Complexity</h5>
            <p>Algorithm complexity is crucial in determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time and space. It is typically measured in Big O notation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input.</li>
              <li><strong>Space Complexity</strong>: Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the size of the input.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h5>Algorithm Usage</h5>
            <p>Algorithms are used in various applications such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sorting and searching large datasets</li>
              <li>Optimization problems (e.g., shortest path, resource allocation)</li>
              <li>Network routing and graph traversal</li>
              <li>Machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, neural networks)</li>
              <li>Data compression and encryption</li>
            </ul>
